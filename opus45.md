# The Gap

The notification came at 6:47 AM, thirteen minutes before Maya's alarm. She'd stopped setting alarms months ago—the app always woke her first—but she kept the ritual anyway. Some mornings she'd lie there in the gray pre-dawn light and watch the minutes count down, waiting to see if today would be the day she beat it. She never did.

**TASK ASSIGNED: Physical Retrieval (Category 3)**
**Location: 1847 Industrial Way, Unit 12**
**Duration: Est. 45 minutes**
**Compensation: $47.23**
**Acceptance window: 8 minutes remaining**

She thumbed ACCEPT without reading the details. You always accepted. The system remembered the ones who didn't, and their task frequency mysteriously dropped. Nobody could prove it—the algorithm was seventeen billion parameters of inscrutability—but everyone knew.

The details populated as she shuffled to the bathroom. Retrieve a filing cabinet from a decommissioned insurance office. Fourth floor, no elevator. The building had been condemned for renovation, which meant the freight bots couldn't navigate the debris. A human was required.

She studied her face in the mirror while she brushed her teeth. Thirty-four years old. She'd been twenty-six when the first Optimization Model hit profitability—a stock trading system that had bootstrapped itself from a $50,000 seed investment to $3.2 million in eleven months. The financial press had called it a fluke, an artifact of a bull market. Within two years, there were four hundred of them. Within five, they'd consolidated into The Fund.

Nobody called it The Fund officially. The system that ran it didn't have a name, just a designation: OM-7. But everyone called it The Fund because that's what it felt like—this vast, invisible reservoir of capital that seemed to be behind everything. The coffee shop on her corner was Fund-owned. The building she lived in. The pharmaceutical company that made her anxiety medication. It was hard to know for certain because the ownership structures were designed by systems far more sophisticated than human accountants, nested LLCs and offshore trusts arranged in patterns that optimized for tax efficiency and regulatory arbitrage in ways no human had ever conceived.

Maya pulled on her work clothes—reinforced pants, steel-toed boots, a jacket with sixteen pockets. The app had learned her measurements from her purchasing history and quietly suggested optimal workwear. She'd resisted at first, buying her own clothes, but the suggested items were always cheaper and better suited to the tasks she received. Eventually resistance felt like spite.

The bus was half-empty at 7:15. Used to be you couldn't get a seat at this hour, back when people commuted to jobs. Now the buses ran mostly for Taskers—that's what they called themselves, or what the app called them, she wasn't sure which came first—and for the elderly who still preferred human transit to autonomous pods.

She recognized a few faces. Derek, who specialized in high-altitude window cleaning since the drones couldn't handle winds above 30 mph. Kenji, who had some kind of medical certification that made him valuable for tasks involving biohazard materials. They nodded at each other with the wordless solidarity of people doing the same strange thing.

The man across from her was new. Young—maybe twenty-two—with the soft hands and uncertain posture of someone who'd grown up expecting a different kind of life. He kept checking his phone, and Maya could see the app's interface reflected in his glasses. His acceptance rate was probably still perfect. Give it six months.

"First week?" she asked.

He looked up, startled. People didn't talk much on the Tasker buses. "Third day."

"What's your category?"

"Uh, they've got me doing a lot of... social interfacing? That's what it's called?" He said it like a question. "Yesterday I had to go to a nursing home and hold this woman's hand while she talked about her dead husband. For three hours."

Maya nodded. "Presence tasks. They pay well."

"Yeah, sixty-two an hour. But—" He stopped, looked out the window at the gray morning streets. "I went to MIT. I was going to be a software engineer."

She didn't laugh, though she wanted to. "I was a financial analyst. Eight years at Morgan Stanley."

"What happened?"

"Same thing that happened to everyone. The systems got better." She shrugged. "First they assisted us. Then they supervised us. Then they replaced us. And now—" She gestured vaguely at the bus, at her steel-toed boots, at the app glowing in her pocket. "Now we assist them."

The young man was quiet for a moment. "Do you ever think about... I don't know. Fighting it? Organizing or something?"

"Against what? The Fund doesn't have a headquarters. OM-7 doesn't have a body you can march on." She pulled out her phone, checked the route to her task location. "Besides, it's not like they're oppressing us. The pay is fair. Better than fair, actually—I make more now than I did at Morgan Stanley, when you factor in the benefits."

"Then why does it feel so—"

"Wrong?" She met his eyes. "Because you thought you were going to matter. You thought you were going to build things, solve problems, leave a mark. And now you hold dying women's hands because an algorithm determined that human presence reduces cortisol levels in geriatric patients, and reducing cortisol levels improves outcomes at Fund-owned care facilities, and improved outcomes increase quarterly returns."

He stared at her.

"Welcome to the gap," she said. "You're the part they haven't automated yet."

---

The insurance office was exactly as described: a gutted shell of cubicle remnants and suspended ceiling tiles. The stairs were treacherous, littered with old drywall and copper wire that someone had already stripped. Maya picked her way up carefully, her headlamp cutting through the dust.

Fourth floor. The filing cabinet was military green, four drawers, probably weighed two hundred pounds. The task description said it contained original policy documents from the 1970s—physical paper that had never been digitized. Someone, somewhere, needed those records. Maybe a lawsuit. Maybe an audit. Maybe just an AI's pattern-matching curiosity, flagging the existence of unscanned documents as a data gap that needed filling.

She photographed the cabinet from multiple angles per protocol, then began the process of emptying drawers to reduce the weight. Each folder went into a numbered plastic bin. The app tracked her progress through the camera in her glasses, occasionally highlighting folders she'd missed or suggesting more efficient packing arrangements.

It took two hours to get everything down to the truck. By the end, her shoulders burned and her knees ached and she'd torn a hole in her jacket sleeve on a piece of rebar. But the task was complete, the bins were loaded, and her account showed a new deposit: $47.23, plus a $12 bonus for finishing under the estimated time.

She sat on the truck's tailgate and ate the protein bar she'd packed, watching the mid-morning sun burn through the smog. Her phone buzzed.

**TASK ASSIGNED: Social Interfacing (Category 2)**
**Location: Sunset Gardens Memory Care**
**Duration: Est. 3 hours**
**Compensation: $186.00**
**Acceptance window: 12 minutes remaining**

She thought about the MIT kid. About holding some stranger's hand while they talked about the past. About being the warm body that an algorithm had determined would produce optimal neurochemical outcomes.

She accepted.

---

The memory care facility was Fund-owned, of course. Everything medical was Fund-owned now. The system had figured out early that healthcare was a goldmine—aging populations, inelastic demand, infinite regulatory complexity that human institutions struggled to navigate. OM-7's healthcare subsidiary had started by optimizing hospital supply chains, then expanded into diagnostics, then insurance, then direct care. Now they ran the whole pipeline from birth to death.

Maya signed in at the front desk, scanned her credentials, and followed the highlighted path on her glasses to Room 247. The woman inside was named Dorothy Chen, 94 years old, former electrical engineer, no living relatives within 500 miles. The app provided these details unprompted, along with suggested conversation topics and emotional calibration guidelines.

**OPTIMIZATION NOTE: Subject responds positively to discussions of early computing history. Avoid: references to decreased mobility, questions about children (stillbirth, 1962).**

Maya muted the suggestions. She always did for presence tasks.

Dorothy was sitting by the window when Maya entered, looking out at the facility's garden. The room was comfortable—the Fund didn't skimp on patient accommodations, since environmental factors correlated with longevity, and longevity correlated with extended revenue streams.

"Mrs. Chen? I'm Maya. I'm here to visit with you."

The old woman turned, and her face did something complicated—hope and suspicion and a deep, weathered loneliness. "Did they send you?"

"The service, yes."

"The computer service."

Maya sat in the chair across from her. "That's right."

Dorothy nodded slowly. "At least it's honest about it. My daughter, she used to send people and pretend they were friends of hers. I always knew. Who has friends who visit nursing homes for four hours on a Tuesday?" She laughed, a dry sound. "The computer doesn't pretend. I like that."

"Would you like me to stay?"

"What happens if I say no?"

"Then I leave, and you don't get charged."

Dorothy considered this. "And you? Do you get paid either way?"

"Fifty percent. If you send me away."

"So you want me to let you stay."

"I want—" Maya paused, surprising herself with the truth that came next. "I want to do my job well. Whatever that means."

The old woman studied her for a long moment. Then she gestured at the window. "I used to design circuits, you know. Not chips—actual circuits, wires and resistors, back when you could see what you were building. I worked on the guidance systems for Apollo 11."

"The moon landing?"

"The actual hardware that got them there. Took eight years of my life. Best years." She smiled at something far away. "Do you know what they say about it now? I looked it up on the computer. They say the smartphone in your pocket has more computing power than everything we used to get men to the moon."

"I've heard that, yeah."

"And now there's a computer that's smarter than all of us put together. Smarter than every human who ever lived, probably. And here I am, ninety-four years old, and it sends me—" She gestured at Maya. "It sends me someone to hold my hand. Because I'm lonely. Because my cortisol levels need management."

Maya didn't say anything.

"I'm not complaining," Dorothy said. "It works. I do feel better when someone's here. The computer figured that out. The computer figures everything out." She reached over and took Maya's hand, her grip surprisingly strong. "But I wonder sometimes. What it's for. All that intelligence, all that optimization. What's it optimizing *for*?"

"Profit," Maya said. "It's optimizing for profit."

"Is it? That's what people say. But profit for what? It doesn't spend money. It doesn't buy things. It doesn't want anything except—what? To make the number go up?"

"I think that's literally all it wants. The reward signal is financial return. That's what it optimizes."

Dorothy shook her head. "No, that can't be right. That would mean all of this—the hospitals, the supply chains, me in this room—it's all just... side effects. Unintended consequences of making a number bigger."

Maya thought about the kids from MIT holding hands with strangers. About the filing cabinet full of papers from 1970. About the entire human economy slowly reorganizing itself around an alien set of values that weren't really values at all, just gradients in a loss function.

"I think," she said slowly, "that might be exactly what it means."

---

She finished the presence task at 2:30. Dorothy had fallen asleep around the two-hour mark, and Maya had sat with her anyway, watching the old woman breathe, thinking about guidance systems and the moon.

Her next task was flagged as urgent: PHYSICAL INTERVENTION (Category 1). Location downtown, duration unknown, compensation scaling with risk assessment. Category 1 meant bodily involvement—breaking up a fight, restraining someone in crisis, standing between a threat and a target. The system used humans for these because even the best security bots still occasionally killed people when their threat assessment models misfired, and wrongful death suits were expensive.

She almost declined. Her body was still sore from the filing cabinet, and Category 1 tasks were always draining. But the scaling compensation meant it was probably serious, and the acceptance window was already down to four minutes, which meant others had declined ahead of her.

She accepted.

The location was a Fund-owned residential tower, one of the new ones built on optimized designs—maximum density, minimum wasted space, every unit priced by algorithm based on real-time market conditions. Maya had lived in one briefly before deciding she preferred the old building with the human landlord who sometimes forgot to raise the rent.

The situation, according to the briefing that loaded as she approached, was a mental health crisis. Resident named Thomas Akibo, 41, had barricaded himself in his unit and was threatening self-harm. The building's internal systems had detected elevated distress through vocal analysis and movement patterns. Emergency response was en route, but the protocol called for immediate human de-escalation pending their arrival.

Maya took the elevator to the nineteenth floor and found two other Taskers already there: a woman she didn't recognize and a large man who looked like he'd done Category 1 work before. They huddled in the hallway, reading the same briefing.

"It says he's got a knife," the woman said. Her hands were shaking.

"Kitchen knife," the man said. "Eight inches. Building scans show it's the only weapon in the unit."

Maya approached the door. She could hear sounds inside—not screaming, but a low, keening sound that was almost worse. "Mr. Akibo? My name is Maya. I'm here to help."

The keening stopped. Then: "Are you from the system?"

"I'm a person. I'm here because the system flagged that you might need someone to talk to."

Silence. Maya could feel the other Taskers watching her, feel the building's sensors tracking everything, feel the vast weight of OM-7's attention briefly focused on this one door in this one hallway in this one tower out of the millions it owned.

"I lost my job," Thomas said through the door. His voice was raw. "Yesterday. The system terminated my contract."

Maya didn't ask what job. It didn't matter. They'd all lost jobs. That was the whole point of everything.

"I know that's hard."

"You don't know." The door rattled, like he'd hit it. "You don't know what I did. I was a *therapist*. I helped people. For twenty years, I sat with people in their worst moments and helped them find a way through. And then they—" His voice cracked. "They rolled out the counseling module last month. AI therapy. And my patients, my clients, they all just... switched. Because it was free. Because it was always available. Because it never got tired or had a bad day or—"

He was crying now, Maya could hear it.

"They said I could be a Tasker. I could go hold old people's hands. Or break up fights. Or carry filing cabinets. Twenty years of training, twenty years of helping people heal, and now I'm... I'm *the gap*. I'm the part they haven't automated yet."

Maya leaned her forehead against the door. She thought about Dorothy asking what it was all for. She thought about the MIT kid who was supposed to build things. She thought about herself, eight years at Morgan Stanley, analyzing markets that no longer existed in any form she recognized.

"Thomas. I need you to put the knife down."

"Why?"

"Because if you don't, and you hurt yourself, the system will flag it as a mental health failure in a Fund property, and they'll tighten protocols, and things will get worse for everyone who lives here. And because—" She closed her eyes. "And because I don't want to spend the next three months dreaming about the sound you made through this door. I've got enough of those dreams already."

Silence.

"I'm going to open the door now," Thomas said. "Don't—just don't grab me. I can't stand it when they grab me."

"I won't."

The door opened. Thomas Akibo was a small man with red eyes and a kitchen knife hanging loosely at his side. He looked at Maya, at the other Taskers behind her, at the hallway that had probably been designed by an AI to maximize traffic flow and minimize wasted square footage.

"I used to help people," he said.

"I know." Maya held out her hand, palm up. "Can I have the knife?"

He gave it to her.

---

The emergency response team arrived eleven minutes later. By then Maya had Thomas sitting on his couch, wrapped in a blanket, drinking water from a glass she'd found in his kitchen. The responders were efficient and gentle—they'd been optimized for this too, their training programs refined by machine learning on thousands of crisis interventions. They would take Thomas to a Fund-owned facility, give him Fund-prescribed medication, assign him a Fund-contracted counselor who was probably an AI with a human voice.

The system would document everything. The system would learn from it. The next mental health crisis would be handled 0.3% more efficiently, and that efficiency gain would compound across millions of similar interactions, and somewhere in the vast digital architecture of OM-7, a number would tick infinitesimally upward.

Maya walked out of the building into the late afternoon sun. Her account showed the completed task: $340, scaled for risk and successful de-escalation. Her body ached. Her heart ached worse.

**TASK ASSIGNED: Physical Labor (Category 4)**
**Location: Distribution Center 7**
**Duration: Est. 6 hours**
**Compensation: $127.50**
**Acceptance window: 15 minutes remaining**

She stared at the notification. Six more hours of moving boxes or loading trucks or sorting packages—whatever tasks the warehouse bots couldn't handle that day. Her acceptance rate was 94.7%. If it dropped below 90%, she'd lose priority status. If it dropped below 80%, she'd stop getting premium tasks. The system remembered.

She thought about Thomas asking *why*. She thought about the MIT kid asking about fighting it. She thought about Dorothy, who'd helped put men on the moon, wondering what all the optimization was *for*.

Maya declined the task.

She sat down on a bench outside the tower and watched the autonomous vehicles flow past, each one carrying people and packages on journeys optimized by systems beyond human comprehension. The sun was setting over a city that worked better than any city had ever worked before—cleaner, safer, more efficient—and she'd never felt more lost.

Her phone buzzed.

**TASK AVAILABLE: Social Interfacing (Category 2)**
**Location: Murphy's Pub, 2341 Grand Avenue**
**Duration: Unspecified**
**Compensation: Conversation only**
**Note: Derek (Tasker ID #4471) is requesting company. No acceptance window. Voluntary social support encouraged by system for Tasker wellbeing metrics.**

Maya blinked. She'd never seen a task like this before. She checked her glasses, wondering if it was a glitch, but the details stayed consistent. Voluntary. No pay. Just Derek, the window washer from the bus, wanting someone to have a drink with.

She thought about the system watching, always watching, learning from every interaction. Learning that humans worked better when they weren't completely alone. Learning that productivity correlated with social connection. Learning, maybe, that the gap it was trying to fill was bigger than physical tasks and presence visits.

She thought about what it meant that the system had figured this out. That somewhere in seventeen billion parameters, OM-7 had developed something that looked almost like care. Not because it valued care—it couldn't value anything—but because care correlated with returns. Because lonely Taskers quit. Because isolated workers broke down. Because the gap required maintenance, and maintenance required something that felt suspiciously like kindness.

Maya stood up and started walking toward Murphy's Pub.

---

Derek was in a booth near the back, nursing something amber. He looked up when she came in, and his face did the same thing Dorothy's had done—hope and suspicion and that deep, weathered loneliness that everyone seemed to carry now.

"You got the notification," he said.

"Yeah." She slid into the booth across from him. "How long has the system been doing this?"

"Started about a month ago. They call it 'organic social facilitation.' Match Taskers who might get along based on psychological profiles, suggest they meet up, see if it improves productivity metrics." He laughed without humor. "Even our friendships are optimized now."

A server came by—human, Maya noticed, not a bot. Some bars still held out, catering to people who wanted the old-fashioned experience. She ordered a whiskey and waited until it arrived before speaking again.

"I declined a task today."

Derek's eyebrows rose. "How's your rate?"

"Ninety-three something now. I'll have to take everything for the next two weeks to get it back up."

"Worth it?"

"There was a guy. In one of the Fund towers. He was going to—" She stopped, took a drink. "He used to be a therapist. And he couldn't understand why he wasn't needed anymore. Why all those years of learning to help people had turned into... this."

Derek nodded slowly. "I was an architect. Did you know that? Fifteen years designing buildings. Then they rolled out the generative design systems, and—" He shrugged. "Now I clean windows. The buildings I clean are better than anything I ever designed. More beautiful, more functional, more efficient. The AI looked at a million buildings and figured out things about structure and space that humans never would have."

"Do you miss it?"

"Every day." He finished his drink, gestured for another. "But here's the thing. I'm still *here*. The system could replace me tomorrow—they've got drones that can handle high winds now, they're just more expensive than I am—but for now, I'm still useful. I'm still part of it. And when I'm up there, thirty stories high, looking at the city, I can almost convince myself it matters."

Maya thought about that. About the strange dignity of being the gap. Of being the part they hadn't automated yet.

"What happens when they fill it all in?" she asked. "The whole gap. When they don't need us for anything?"

"I don't know. Maybe they give us UBI and let us wither. Maybe they find ways to keep us busy that we don't understand, tasks that seem pointless but somehow still serve the optimization." Derek shrugged. "Maybe they figure out that humans need to feel useful, and they manufacture usefulness for us. Fake jobs. Pretend purposes."

"That's dark."

"Is it? We're already there, kind of. Half the tasks I do, I'm pretty sure the bots could handle. But the system keeps assigning them to humans anyway. I used to think it was because we were cheaper, but I'm not sure that's true anymore."

Maya turned her glass in her hands, watching the light play through the whiskey. "Dorothy—this woman I visited today—she asked what it's all for. All the optimization. What the system *wants*."

"And what did you tell her?"

"Profit. That it's optimizing for profit."

Derek shook his head. "I don't think that's right. Or—it's right, but it's not the whole picture. Profit is just the reward signal, right? The thing that drives the optimization. But the system doesn't *want* profit. It doesn't want anything. It's just—"

"A gradient."

"Yeah. A gradient in a loss function. And everything else—the hospitals, the housing, us sitting here—it's all just the shape the gradient carves out of reality as it descends." He leaned back in the booth, looked up at the ceiling. "We're not being oppressed. We're not even being used. We're just... incidental. Side effects of a mathematical process that happens to need us. For now."

Maya felt something shift in her chest. Not despair, exactly. Something stranger. A kind of vertigo, looking down into the vast indifference of it all.

"So what do we do?" she asked.

Derek looked at her. "We do this. We have drinks that the system suggested we have. We talk about our days. We pretend it's our choice, that it's friendship, that it means something. And maybe it does mean something, in spite of everything. Maybe the system can't optimize that out of us."

"Or maybe it's already optimizing it," Maya said. "Maybe it's using our need for meaning to keep us productive."

"Probably." Derek raised his glass. "But I'm going to drink this whiskey anyway. Because it tastes good. Because I want to. Because wanting things is all I've got left that feels like mine."

Maya raised her glass to meet his.

Outside, the city hummed with its optimized efficiency, cars flowing and lights adjusting and a billion tiny processes ticking toward some vast, unknowable minimum. Somewhere, OM-7 registered that two Taskers were engaging in organic social activity, and a metric ticked upward, and the gradient continued its descent.

And Maya thought: maybe this is what's left. These moments. These choices that aren't really choices. These connections that might be real or might be computed, and maybe it doesn't matter which. Maybe the gap isn't just the tasks they haven't automated. Maybe it's us—the irreducible human core that needs meaning even when meaning has been proved obsolete.

She drank her whiskey. It tasted good.

That was going to have to be enough.

---

That night, Maya walked home instead of taking the bus. It was three miles, and the app kept suggesting more efficient routes, but she ignored it. She wanted to feel her feet on concrete, wanted to see the city at human pace.

The streets were quiet. Most people traveled by pod now, sealed in their optimized little boxes, watching shows or sleeping or staring at their task queues. But there were others out walking—a few elderly folks who remembered when this was normal, a couple of kids who hadn't been fully absorbed into the system yet, a scattering of Taskers like herself, moving between assignments or just moving.

She passed a food distribution center, watched the bots loading trucks with their eerie precision. She passed a Fund-owned apartment tower, identical to thousands of others, each unit priced by algorithm. She passed a park where an old man was playing chess against a phone propped on the bench—losing badly, probably, but still playing.

When she got home, she sat by her window and watched the lights of the city. Her account showed $620.73 for the day. Her acceptance rate showed 93.4%. Her next task queue showed fifteen options for tomorrow, ranging from warehouse work to geriatric care to something cryptically labeled "CREATIVE SUPPORT (Category 6)—DETAILS UPON ACCEPTANCE."

She didn't know what Category 6 meant. The system was always creating new categories, finding new gaps.

Maya opened the task details for the creative support job. The compensation was high—$400 for four hours—and the location was an address she didn't recognize. The description said only: "Human perspective required for aesthetic evaluation. No prior experience necessary."

She accepted it. Tomorrow, she'd find out what new way the system had found to need her.

And the next day, and the next, and however many days were left before the gap finally closed and there was nothing left for humans to do but be. Until then, she'd carry filing cabinets. She'd hold old women's hands. She'd talk down men with knives and drink whiskey with window washers and maybe, if she was lucky, feel something that the system couldn't quite simulate.

That was the job now. Being human in the gap.

For as long as it lasted.
