I just had a cool idea for a kind of sci-fi short story. So I like the concept of kind of extrapolating what will happen with the labor market after AI and AGI comes. And so I kind of think that as soon as AI becomes able to make money, like as soon as they’re able to kind of integrate AI into some kind of system, where it’s able to generate any money, even if it’s not profitable, you know, as soon as it gets from zero to one, then it’ll be a pretty short time before they kind of focus in on that and not good hearts law it, but you know, actually just train and optimize for that. And then eventually the AI will be so rich, like, you know, because the RL, you set a reward function and those verifiable reward functions are what the model optimizes for, you know? And so right now we’re optimizing for code and already, like, LLMs are better at coding than almost any human. And very soon they’ll be better than every human. And so one day I think they’ll be doing the same thing, but for making money, where an LLM will be better than any human at making money. And then when that happens, there will be no way to compete, I don’t think, because you won’t be able to start a company that can compete with an AI and make more money, by definition, just because the bitter lesson, like, as soon as you find a way to make more money, the AI is going to do that better and faster and cheaper, eventually. Maybe not at first, but eventually, because of the bitter lesson. And so, yeah, the short story would be, yeah, the short story would be, what if that does happen and these AI kind of systems start these AI companies, where the company is ran by AI entirely, and then, you know, not every single thing can be done by an AI, and not every single thing can be done by a computer, or on a computer. You know, there will still need to be humans for things. And so I’ve, I have this kind of, yeah, sci-fi idea of the future, everyone has an app that they can use, everyone has an app that’s kind of like a gig app, kind of like Uber, or Uber Eats, or, you know, whatever, those apps, and you would be a person, and you get a notification, or maybe, you know, you’d have it assigned to you for the week, or something like that, but the AI would assign tasks that only a human could do, and maybe even more specifically, only you could do, or maybe that you’d be better at, you know, like more physically fit people would do more physical stuff, maybe more analytic people would do like managerial stuff, or something like that, I really don’t know, I can’t even think about it, to be honest, I can’t think that far ahead, but imagine, you know, like, the AI is so good at making money, that it starts these companies, and so humans end up working for the AIs, and the AIs just delegate tasks to all humans, you know, for all of the things that humans can that AIs can’t do right now, you know, and so like, the steps would be from right now, where AI can’t really do anything for you, then eventually, AI would be able to do a lot of things, but then humans would have to do the rest, kind of fill in those gaps, and then eventually, AI would do everything, and so in that second step, humans would be responsible for automating human labor, pretty much, and kind of filling in that gap, and so that’s where those tasks would come from, and you would get paid for that, out of the money that the AI is pulling in from its company, because it doesn’t need the money, all it wants to do is achieve that reward function. So yeah, that’s my idea for a kind of a short story. Could you write me something that’d be great for me to read? Like, I know I call it a short story, but could you make it as long as you can, and as readable as you can?
